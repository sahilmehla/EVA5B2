#Make a network that has:
- 6 Convolution layers with these kernels (10, 10, 20, 20, 30)
- no fully connected layer (you probably may have to use the Global Average Pooling layer)
- uses EMNIST as the dataset
- uses a maximum of 2 max-pooling layers
#Your code MUST be:
- well documented
- must mention the receptive field calculations (as we discussed in the class)
- must mention the input and output size for each layer
- must be trained for minimum of 20 epochs
- training MUST happen on the GPU
- Once done, upload the code with training logs from colab to GitHub, and share the GitHub link
