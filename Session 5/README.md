# Train a model on MNIST dataset such that:
1. Accuracy is 99.4% (this must be consistently shown in your last few epochs, and not a one-time achievement)
2. To be trained in Less than or equal to 15 Epochs
3. Less than 10000 Parameters (additional points for doing this in less than 8000 pts)

# Additional points to be noted :
- Do this in exactly 4 steps
- Each File must have "target, result, analysis" TEXT block (either at the start or the end)
- You must convince why have you decided that your target should be what you have decided it to be, and your analysis MUST be correct. 
- Evaluation is highly subjective, and if you target anything out of the order, marks will be deducted. 
- Explain your 4 steps using these target, results, and analysis with links to your GitHub files (Colab files moved to GitHub). 
- Keep Receptive field calculations handy for each of your models. 
- If your GitHub folder structure or file_names are messy, -100. 
- When ready, attempt S5-Assignment Solution
