### Assignment

1. What are Channels and Kernels (according to EVA)?
2. Why should we (nearly) always use 3x3 kernels?
3. How many times to we need to perform 3x3 convolutions operations to reach close to 1x1 from 199x199 (type each layer output like 199x199 > 197x197...)
4. How are kernels initialized? 
5. What happens during the training of a DNN?
